# API and UX Consistency Plan (70 -> 100)

## Definition of 100

- [x] API status codes and error schema are predictable and documented.
- [x] CLI behavior and messaging match API semantics.
- [x] OpenAPI spec is complete and tested against runtime behavior.
- [x] Interactive shell and logs UX is robust under edge cases.
- [x] Backward compatibility rules are defined and enforced.

## Work items

| ID | Task | Priority | Status | Evidence to close |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| UX-001 | Introduce canonical error response schema: `code`, `message`, `hint`, `details` | P1 | Done | Commit `ded9179`, API error contract tests |
| UX-002 | Align 5xx vs 4xx mapping for transient and state errors (including agent readiness) | P1 | Done | Commits `b44f38c`, `ded9179` |
| UX-003 | Add consistent idempotency semantics for lifecycle and port-forward endpoints | P2 | Done | Commits `00cb6b8`, `ded9179` |
| UX-004 | Improve CLI hints and error normalization across all commands | P2 | Done | Commit `078d7d7`, normalized CLI error handling |
| UX-005 | Add JSON output mode for CLI (`--output json`) with stable schema | P3 | Done | Commit `078d7d7`, CLI output contract tests |
| UX-006 | Complete OpenAPI examples and ensure docs include all platform-specific caveats | P2 | Done | Commits `762f3dc`, `ec097fb`, OpenAPI contract tests + docs |
| UX-007 | Harden shell and logs UX around disconnects, truncation, and close signaling | P2 | Done | Commit `ded9179`, shell/log robustness tests |
| UX-008 | Add compatibility policy and deprecation workflow for API/CLI changes | P3 | Done | Commit `ec097fb`, `docs/compatibility.md` |
