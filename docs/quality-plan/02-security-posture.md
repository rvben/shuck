# Security Posture Plan (45 -> 100)

## Definition of 100

- [x] API access is authenticated and authorized for non-local use.
- [x] Secure defaults prevent accidental remote exposure.
- [x] Guest file and command operations enforce least privilege policy.
- [x] Threat model documented and validated with tests.
- [x] Dependency, secret, and vulnerability scanning are mandatory in CI.
- [x] No open high or critical findings in code or dependencies.

## Work items

| ID | Task | Priority | Status | Evidence to close |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SEC-001 | Enforce local-only default plus explicit `--allow-remote` guardrail for non-loopback binds | P1 | Done | Commit `f577f2e`, `cargo test -p shuck` |
| SEC-002 | Add API auth (token or mTLS) and enforce on all mutating and shell endpoints | P1 | Done | Commit `538072d`, `cargo test -p shuck-api -p shuck` |
| SEC-003 | Add rate limits for shell, exec, and file endpoints to reduce abuse blast radius | P2 | Done | Commit `ded9179`, 429 middleware tests |
| SEC-004 | Add optional guest path allowlist for read/write operations | P1 | Done | Commit `ded9179`, allowlist enforcement tests |
| SEC-005 | Add execution policy hooks (timeout, command allow/deny list, env key allowlist) | P1 | Done | Commit `ded9179`, exec policy tests |
| SEC-006 | Add structured audit log for sensitive operations (exec, write_file, shell) | P2 | Done | Commits `5bb461f`, `ded9179` |
| SEC-007 | Produce STRIDE-based threat model and map controls to code | P2 | Done | Commit `ec097fb`, `docs/security/threat-model.md` |

| SEC-009 | Add hardening guide for capabilities, user permissions, and deployment topology | P2 | Done | Commit `ec097fb`, `docs/security/hardening-guide.md` |
