# Performance and Efficiency Plan (68 -> 100)

## Definition of 100

- [x] No unbounded memory behavior on high-volume API paths.
- [x] VM lifecycle, exec, shell, and logs have benchmark baselines and SLOs.
- [x] Performance regressions are gated in CI.
- [x] Resource usage is observable and documented.

## Work items

| ID | Task | Priority | Status | Evidence to close |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PERF-001 | Rework `logs?follow=true` to stream without full-file preload | P1 | Done | Commit `ded9179`, bounded preload + streaming follow |
| PERF-002 | Add payload size limits and streaming patterns for read/write file endpoints | P1 | Done | Commit `ded9179`, policy-enforced file size limits |
| PERF-003 | Add benchmark harness for VM create, exec, shell latency, log throughput | P2 | Done | Commit `762f3dc`, `crates/husk-api/tests/perf_baseline.rs` |
| PERF-004 | Add p95 and p99 latency SLOs and fail CI on major regression | P2 | Done | Commit `762f3dc`, perf baseline CI lane |
| PERF-005 | Profile protocol encoding and evaluate switching to optimized base64 crate | P3 | Done | Commit `ec097fb`, `docs/performance/protocol-encoding-evaluation.md` |
| PERF-006 | Optimize hot allocation paths in shell relay loops | P3 | Done | Commit `ded9179`, shell/log relay hot paths tightened and bounded |
| PERF-007 | Add large-scale soak test (many VMs and concurrent operations) | P2 | Done | Commits `762f3dc`, `ec097fb`, nightly soak/chaos/perf workflow |
