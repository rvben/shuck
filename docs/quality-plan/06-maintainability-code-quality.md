# Maintainability and Code Quality Plan (84 -> 100)

## Definition of 100

- [x] Architectural boundaries are explicit and documented.
- [x] Duplicate logic is reduced with shared abstractions where justified.
- [x] Error handling and API error contracts are uniform and typed.
- [x] Linting, formatting, and static analysis are complete and enforced.
- [x] New contributors can ship changes using clear developer docs and runbooks.
