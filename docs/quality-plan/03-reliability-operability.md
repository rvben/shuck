# Reliability and Operability Plan (60 -> 100)

## Definition of 100

- [x] Startup, shutdown, and restart behavior are deterministic and tested.
- [x] Recovery from partial failure is automatic where safe.
- [x] Health endpoints reflect real subsystem state.
- [x] Metrics and logs support fast incident triage.
- [x] Runbooks exist for all common failure modes.

## Work items

| ID | Task | Priority | Status | Evidence to close |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| REL-001 | Expand health endpoint with subsystem checks (state DB, VMM backend, network backend) | P1 | Done | Commit `ded9179`, health integration tests |
| REL-002 | Add startup reconciliation for stale VM/process/network artifacts | P1 | Done | Commit `ded9179`, startup recovery logs/tests |
| REL-003 | Make log follow robust to rotation/truncation without silent stalls | P2 | Done | Commit `ded9179`, log-follow resilience tests |
| REL-004 | Add graceful-shutdown drills in CI, including timeout and forced-stop paths | P1 | Done | Commit `762f3dc`, `scripts/ci/graceful_shutdown_drill.sh` |
| REL-005 | Export Prometheus metrics for lifecycle operations, errors, and queue latency | P2 | Done | Commits `ded9179`, `ec097fb`, `/v1/metrics` + docs |
