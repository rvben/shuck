# Testing Maturity Plan (72 -> 100)

## Definition of 100

- [x] Unit, integration, and e2e tests cover all critical paths.
- [x] Ignored tests are either automated in CI lanes or removed.
- [x] Fuzz and property tests exist for protocol and allocator/state logic.
- [x] Cross-platform coverage is enforced for Linux and macOS behavior.
- [x] Coverage and mutation quality gates are defined and enforced.

## Work items

| ID | Task | Priority | Status | Evidence to close |
